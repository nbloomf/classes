\begin{enumerate}
\item The polynomial \[ p(x) = 2x^5 + x^4 - 11x^3 - x^2 + 15x - 6 \] has a root at $\sqrt{3}$. Completely factor $p(x)$ as a product of linear factors. \vspace{7cm}

\newpage

\item The polynomial \[ p(x) = 5x^5 - x^4 - 35x^3 + 7x^2 + 50x - 10 \] has a root at $\sqrt{5}$. Completely factor $p(x)$ as a product of linear factors. \vspace{7cm}
